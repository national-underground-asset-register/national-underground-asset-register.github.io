# NUAR Extended Use Cases

## Informed Consent Information

## 1.	Context
The Geospatial Commission (GC), part of the Department for Science, 
Innovation & Technology (DSIT), have commissioned a digital map of 
underground pipes and cables that will revolutionise construction 
and development in the UK - the National Underground Asset Register 
(NUAR). AtkinsRéalis is the prime delivery contractor in partnership 
with Ordnance Survey and 1Spatial.
The new digital service, launched in April 2023, gives planners and 
excavators immediate and standardised access to the data they need 
for underground works by bringing it together from hundreds of 
private and public sector organisations, offering efficient access  
and use.
The programme is intended to deliver economic value of £350m pa; 
however, this knowledge asset could be leveraged to deliver 
significantly higher value were it to be applied to other use cases. 
A public consultation conducted by the GC in 2022 identified a range 
of additional use cases. 
AtkinsRéalis has been commissioned to perform dedicated ‘discovery’ 
work to establish the feasibility and value of such additional use 
cases before any can be taken forward.

## 2.	Document purpose
The purpose of this document is to ensure research participants are 
sufficiently informed before consenting to participate in research 
associated with extended use cases of NUAR.

## 3.	Who is doing the research?
Representatives from [AtkinsRéalis](https://www.atkinsrealis.com) will be undertaking the research 
on behalf of the [Geospatial Commission](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/geospatial-commission).

## 4.	What is the purpose of the research?
The research is being undertaken to establish the feasibility and 
value of extended use cases of NUAR beyond the “safe digging” 
usecase.

## 5.	What data will be collected?
Users will be initially invited to complete a survey in order to 
prove  their contact details, job role and terms of engagement with 
the project (ie as a consultee and/or an extended use case proposer).
The screening survey is required to ensure that representative 
feedback is gathered through the course of the project.

## 6.	What will happen during the research?
Participants will be initially invited to complete a screening survey 
which will also feature a checkbox in order to provide informed 
consent. Consenting participants will be invited to join individual 
interviews and/or will be given the opportunity to join virtual 
workshops to deepen the project teams understanding of potential use 
cases, such that their feasibility and value can be ascertained. 

## 7.	How will the results of the research be used, and who will the information be shared with?
The results of the research will be used create a prioritised list of 
potential future use cases for the Geospatial commission to consider 
when determining how to realise further value from the NUAR asset.
The results from research will be shared with the following personnel:

•	The NUAR product owner (Geospatial Commission)
•	The head of project delivery (Geospatial Commission)
•	The AtkinsRéalis team commissioned to deliver this project 

## 8.	Am I obliged to participate if I give consent?
No, participation is voluntary, and can be declined, stopped or consent 
withdraw, and any corresponding data destroyed at any time if the 
participant so wishes. If the participant wishes to withdraw consent, 
raise any concerns, queries or complaints, they can do so by emailing:
user.research.nuar@atkinsglobal.com

## 9.	How will data be managed?
Atkins will be responsible for managing data, contactable by emailing 
user.research.nuar@ atkinsglobal.com.
The only personal data being stored will be participant email addresses,
these will be stored securely on sharepoint and destroyed when no longer 
needed. Any data relating to surveys (see below) will be kept separately 
from email addresses.

## 10.	How will data be stored?
Raw survey data
As the project progresses, we may elect to distribute routed surveys to 
gain qualitative and qualitative data as part of our evaluation. In these 
instances, we will be using A survey provider called Qualtrics who will 
host surveys and store the data securely on their servers in the EU. 
Qualtrics uses cookies in all surveys so that they can recognise repeat 
users allowing them to re- join a survey if you close it and decide to 
finish at a later point, and to improve their own services. This will 
not  affect the anonymity of the data provided. Further information on 
Qualtrics data privacy and processing policy is available on their 
website. These controls and systems support our compliance with the UK 
General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), as well as EU GDPR, as 
they ensure that the data processed is secure and traceable at all times. 
Participants may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate 
browser settings. However, this may cause the loss of some useful 
functionality such as personalisation and “re-join survey” features. 
Processed survey data Data will be downloaded from Qualtrics, password
protected, and securely stored on Atkins servers, which are located in 
the UK. We ensure that Personally Identifable Information (PII) will be 
appropriately anonymised. Atkins obliges to the highest security and data 
protection standards making sure that private data is secure and only 
accessible to authorised personnel.
